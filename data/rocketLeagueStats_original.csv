,,NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[1],"Because of not having a fully accurate test at the moment, the Grip stat skews the results for the Sweet Tooth and Merc, so I've given them a value of 7 in that stat for the overall calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[2],Curtesy of ONlocke's testing (https://redd.it/3lpx2d) up to the Supersonic Fury DLC. My own testing confirms his results and I've done my own from the Revenge of the Battles Cars DLC and onwards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[3],"It was discovered that not all vehicles slow down to a stop the same after doing a power slide or freely rolling, so I added another column for it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[4],I copied the old hit box values from my previous testing to have something as a reference for people. I'll be doing better testing for this in the future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
[5],"This is just adding the overall totals for the Maneuvering and the Hit Box together. As testing for the Hit Box isn't completed yet, I added an average ""Hit Box"" value of 18 to the DeLorean, Scarab and Zippy for now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
